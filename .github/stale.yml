    activity in 6 months. It will be closed in 7 days if no further activity occurs.

    Allowing issues to close as stale helps us filter out issues which can wait
    for future development time. All issues closed by stale bot act like normal issues; they can be searched for, commented on or reopened at any point.

    If you'd like a closed stale issue to be considered,
    feel free to either re-open the issue directly or contact a developer.

    it fixed in the near-future. Extending the lifetime of an issue
    may cause the development team to prioritise it over other issues,
    which may be closed as stale instead.
